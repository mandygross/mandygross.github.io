Hi! My name is Mandy. I'm married to my high school sweetheart. We are addicted to coffee, binge-watching tv shows and exploring new cities. We live in the midwest but day dream about the PNW. 

I have a photography business with my best friend and we bake a lot of pumpkin flavored things together while listening to Taylor Swift. 

Some of my favorite things are lattes, Christmas time, Oregon, blankets, Gilmore Girls, fall, my adorable puppy and anything with stripes.
